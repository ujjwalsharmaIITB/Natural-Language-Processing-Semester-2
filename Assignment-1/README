This is assignment 1 of Deep Learning For Natural Language Processing

Palindrome predicter using back-propagation

I have added different models ( with varying hidden neurons )

Main File - Manual_Neural_Network with model saving.ipynb


all the code in this python notebook is segregated in different files
    
* [neural_network_class.py](neural_network_class.py) - contains all the classes that are used to define the model

* [main.py](main.py) - contains the code to run the server (both front and back end)



to run the repository
1. download the required libraries
2. run flask --app main.py run
3. go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://localhost:5000
